## 📂 Project Structure

The project follows a standard 🦋 Flutter project structure with the addition of the 🅱️LoC pattern:

```
bloc_counter_app/
|- lib/
   |- bloc/
      |- counter_bloc.dart
      |- counter_event.dart
      |- counter_state.dart
   |- ui/
      |- counter_screen.dart
   |- main.dart
```

### 🔑 Key Components

- **🅱️LoC**: Manages the business logic and state of the application.
- **🖥️ UI**: Displays the current state and provides user interactions.

### 🅱️LoC Structure

- `counter_bloc.dart`: Contains the 🅱️LoC class which handles the state transitions based on incoming events.
- `counter_event.dart`: Defines the events that can be dispatched to the 🅱️LoC.
- `counter_state.dart`: Defines the possible states the application can be in.
